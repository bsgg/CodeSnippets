When exporting, Blender always uses its own type of coordinate system (Y Forward and Z Up), rather than the standard BVH one, so for importing a file exported from blender, the animation loader will need to have the blender box ticked.

The reason the blender option in the recorder exists, even though it will require users to change settings on import into Blender, is that it will allow the importer to always keep the blender box checked, no matter whether files were re-exported or not.

Either way, can you please try again and make sure that you use the following settings?

BVH Recorder: Blender ☑
Blender: Forward: Y Forward and Up: Z Up
BVH Animation Loader: Blender ☑

With a bit of luck this will fix it. Otherwise I will probably need more information about the skeleton of the model that was used for recording to debug this issue.

One additional note about exporting from Blender: For now, please make sure to check the "Root Translation Only" box.
